# NovelAPI
Not exactly an API as NovelUpdates doesn't have one to use, it just scrapes the website and then at the end returns as a dictionary. 

# Information
* Raitonoberu is async

# Requirements
* lxml
* aiohttp
* bs4

Currently I need to go back and properly test everything; I can already see some html tags I've tried parsing from are incorrect.
